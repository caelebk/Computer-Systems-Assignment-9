Observation/Explaination:
We can see that is_reading_pending acts as the interrupt service routine signal, meaning that the sum wont get incremented by the result unless
is_reading_pending is == 0, which signals that the disk has put the data in the block. We can also see that the time increases when we input larger
numbers. This is due to the fact that our number gets converted into the variable num_blocks, in which, means we have more blocks to sum because we 
inputted a larger amount of num_blocks, which then also requires more disk reads. As such, we're constantly waiting for the disk to write data in the block
and so the more blocks we add the more we have to wait for the disk to write data. Finally when the data is done being written, we can output the sum of all
the results from the disk reads.
